# Instabot Funding Bot


A simple first pass at a funding bot. Offers your funding balance for lending.

It uses the Bitfinex API v2, using Websockets, so it's pretty efficient.

It shares some code with my Algorithmic Trading bot (also open source on Github - https://instabot42.github.io/)


## Basic setup

Clone the repo, then...

```bash
cd funding-bot
npm install
npm run setup
```

The last command will create your default local config, so now edit the new `config/local.json` file.

Add you API keys. I recommend that you create new keys for this -
needs read and write permission for Margin Funding (so it can query offers and place new offers),
plus read permission for your wallet (so it knows how much you have to offer). Don't give it any more
permission than it needs.

Also add settings for each symbol you want the bot to trade on. There is an example for BTC included.

And finally, to start the app running...

```bash
npm run start
```

## Config

All configuration is found in the `config/local.json` file (created with `npm run setup`).

The default setup will look a bit like this....

```json
{
  "credentials": {
    "key": "api-key",
    "secret": "api-secret"
  },
  "funding": [
    {
      "symbol": "btc",
      "sleep": 5,
      "offers": [
        {
          "amount": 100,
          "frrMultipleLow": 0.5,
          "frrMultipleHigh": 5.0,
          "atLeastLow": 0.0,
          "atLeastHigh": 0.1,
          "lendingPeriodLow": 0.01,
          "lendingPeriodHigh": 0.1,
          "minOrderSize": 0.02,
          "orderCount": 10,
          "randomAmountsPercent": 5,
          "easing": "linear"
        }
      ],
      "alerts": [
        {
          "rate": 0.01,
          "alertMessage": "BTC funding rate broken 0.01% #funding"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "server": {
    "logLevel": 1,
    "updateIntervalMinutes": 60,
    "alertWebhook": ""
  }
}
```

##### credentials

Put your API keys in here.

##### funding

This contains an list of all the different funding markets you want to trade in. The values have the following meanings...

- symbol: The name of the symbol (btc, usd, ltc and eth are supported by Bitfinex at the moment)
- sleep: how long to wait after cancelling orders before trying to place new orders
- offers: an array of offers to make on the symbol. Funds are allocated to each offer in order (so the first offer gets first shout on any available funds). Each offer contains the following settings...
  - amount: Percentage of your available funds to use on this offer. Ideally, the amounts of all offers for a symbol should add up to 100, assuming you want to use all your funds.
  - frrMultipleLow: Used to determine the lower end of the range for offers. Current FRR * frrMultipleLow
  - frrMultipleHigh: The FRR multiplier used to find the high end of the range of prices to offer at
  - atLeastLow: The lowest funding rate that will be used. If the frrMultipleLow resulted in a value lower than this, then this will be used instead
  - atLeastHigh: Similar toatLeastLow, only for the higher end of the range
  - lendingPeriodLow: Every offer below this value will be offered for the lowest allowed time (2 days)
  - lendingPeriodHigh: All offers over this value will be offered for the longest allowed time (30 days). Rates between the low and high will calculate a suitable offer period between the 2 and 30 days.
  - minOrderSize: The smallest order size the bot should try and use. Note that Bitfinex has a min order size of around $50 equivalent
  - orderCount: The ideal number of orders to place. May be less than this when there are not enough funds to provide orderCount * minOrderSize orders.
  - randomAmountsPercent: How much (as a percentage) to randomise order sizes by. eg, 5 would result in order sizes being +-5% from the default amount. If available funds are limited and minOrderSize is taking effect, the randomisation will be reduced to attempt to keep all orders above the min.
  - easing: The easing method used to spread the orders out in the range. defaults to 'linear'. can be one of linear, easein, easeout, easeinout, easeincubic, easeinquart, easeinquint.

##### Alerts

- rate: The funding rate that must be crossed for the alert to fire.
- maxFrequency: A number, in minutes. The alert can fire at most every maxFrequency minutes. This is to prevent a surge of alerts if the funding rate is fluctuating rapidly above and below the trigger rate.
- alertMessage: The message to send in the webhook

The funding bot can alert you when the funding rates exceeds some threshold you set. It does this by calling a webhook that you
define. This can be used to push alerts from the bot to services like [Alertatron](https://alertatron.com/),
[IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/), or [Zapier](https://zapier.com/).

You will need to provide a webhook URL in the `server.alertWebhook` setting for alerts to work.
This URL will be called each time an alert is triggered.

Each symbol can contain a list of alerts. If the funding rate exceeds `rate`, then the webhook is called (HTTP POST)
with the `alertMessage` passed in a parameter called `message`.


##### server

This section contains some more general settings.

- logLevel: 2 for debug output, 0 for no output. 1 for some
- updateIntervalMinutes: The number of minutes to wait between each update. It defaults to 60, so every hour the
  funding bot will cancel all your open offers and recalculate where to place them. This will re-allocate any funding
  that has expired and returned to you.
- alertWebhook: covered in the alerts section above. Basically the URL that should be called each time an alert is fired.
